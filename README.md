# XOR-NeuralNetwork-NumPy
XOR Deep Neural network using only NumPy and mpl_toolkits.mplot3d Axes 3D. Generally, in Classification problems a single perceptron (‘line’) is enough for Binary Classification. In AND &amp; OR gate a single perceptron is enough for correct classification. In the case of XOR, a single perceptron isn’t enough to correctly classify it.
